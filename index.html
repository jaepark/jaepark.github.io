        <p class="lead">Elizabeth graduated from the University of Washington with a Bachelor of Music in Cello Performance and studied under the tutelage of Toby Saks, Eric Gaenslen, and Sæunn Thorsteinsdóttir. During her studies at the UW, Elizabeth was the recipient of the Delores Gail Plath Music Scholarship. She also served as principal cellist of the UW Symphony Orchestra. Elizabeth is also actively involved in chamber music and has performed in solo master classes with cellists Hans Jorgen Jensen and Ani Kalayjian.</p>
